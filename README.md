# Overview

For this project I decided to create a Sudoku game in Python and PyGame to further advance my programming skills in this language. 

To play this game you select the a number on the right hand side and input it where you believe it goes. The rules of Sudoku are pretty simple. You must fill in all columns, rows, and 3x3 grids with the numbers 1-9 without using repeated numbers. In this game I created it will highlight the number you input as red if it is incorrect and green if it is correct. Once you have completed the game you can press the space bar to restart the game and play again. It will randomize the numbers so it is not the same game every time.

I decided to write this software or game because it is a game I have always enjoyed and wanted to progress my skills as a programmer. I have yet to create an actual game especially with a GUI so I thought this would be a great place to start.

# Development Environment

For this game I used python and pygame. To run the actual game I used Py Charm community since it has a "Run Game" feature unlike vscode.

# Future Work

* Create difficulties (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
* I need to fix the grid so you can add numbers to every missing block.
* Add a quit function so you can close the GUI with the X button in the corner.
